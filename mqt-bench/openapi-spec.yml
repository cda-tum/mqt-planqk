          description: |
            The name of the benchmark to be executed.
            See https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/Benchmark_selection.html for a list of available benchmarks.
          example: "ghz"
        circuit_size:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The size of the circuit to be executed.
            The meaning of this parameter depends on the benchmark.
            For most benchmarks, it is the number of qubits.
            Need not be specified for the "shor" and "groundstate" benchmarks.
          example: 3
        benchmark_instance_name:
          type: string
          description: |
            The name of the benchmark instance to be executed.
            Must be specified for the "shor" and "groundstate" benchmarks.
            Can be either "small", "medium", or "large" for both benchmarks and "xsmall" or "xlarge" in addition for the "shor" benchmark.
          example: "small"
